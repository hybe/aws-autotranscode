# AWS Lambda to encode incoming media files automagically

This is an AWS Lambda Javascript function that works as an automated HLS streaming media encoder triggered by new files in S3, by creating jobs in AWS Elastic Transcoder. It's compatible with testing locally with node.js thanks to the Lambda boilerplate by [SC5](http://sc5.io/). Inspiration from the [Sitebase example](https://gist.github.com/Sitebase/1004af7d738929d0a7f1) on github. 

Hello

## Quick Start (run in the cloud)

* Paste src/index.js content to a AWS Lambda code editor
* Fill in the correct bucket names, metadata and pipeline ID
* Set the script as handler for AWS S3 ObjectCreated (All) events, with a file extension filter for your media file type
* Make sure the Lambda role has permissions to read and write to the buckets you chose. 

### Manifest file

The code assumes the following structure in the source bucket:

    [bucket-root]/[mediaID]/manifest.json
    [bucket-root]/[mediaID]/[media-file-name].[ext]

Take a look at the sample directory for a sample. The manifest file is mainly used in our setup to copy human-selected thumbnails and metadata to the right place along the publishing process, but the script could be adapted to use just the media file as input. manifest.json has the following structure:

    {
        "mediaID":"0daa547b24de47cab0b1fdd20fd5dad0",
        "date":1441257874000,
        "thumbnails":["0daa547b24de47cab0b1fdd20fd5dad0_large.jpg"],
        "media":"0daa547b24de47cab0b1fdd20fd5dad0_hybe_teaser_45s-v2.mp4"
    }

*NOTE* the manifest file must be present in the directory when the media file triggers the lambda, otherwise the script will fail. This has not been a problem in the [HYBE.com](http://hybe.com) setup at least - the media file transfer takes the longest time over the metadata.

### Outputs

By default, the script generates HLS playlists for adaptive streaming to compatible clients - modern browsers and devices - using the AWS Elastic Transcoder presets. These can be easily changed, added, removed etc. 

## Installation for local testing

### Prerequisites

Clone the project and trigger installation of the project dependencies by

    > git clone https://github.com/hybe/aws-autotranscode.git [module name]
    > cd [module name]
    > npm install

Set up your AWS credentials e.g. to ~/.aws/credentials (see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html). e.g.
    
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = [YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
    aws_secret_access_key = [YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]

Set up your lambda environment by copying example_lambdaenv.json to lambdaenv.json and setting the parameter values. You will need an AWS IAM role for use with your Lambda function.

## Development

Set up your module information into package.json prior to deployment

### Project layout

    src/    The source of the Lambda function (index.js)
    tests/  The tests for the Lambda function. Tests to run must start with test_
    gulpfile.js     The gulpfile used for deployment
    package.json    The package file for the module. Defines the function name, version and dependencies

## Testing locally

Run gulp tests. 

    > gulp test

Tests reside in the tests/directory. Uses lambda-wrapper module to wrap the code.

## Deploying to AWS

The module is deployed to Lambda using
    
    > gulp deploy

This will create a new lamda function to the region defined in lambdaenv.json with the name [module_name]_[version] (cleaned up from illegal characters)


## Release History

* 2016/01/05 - v0.1.0 - Initial version of the transcoder lambda
